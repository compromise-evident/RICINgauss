/* RICINgauss log



Version 1       Transformers will have interference I was able to  mitigate only
                by greatly increasing power.Everything gets quiet down to a halt
                then plays again and this comes in waves,for all coils and items
                tried. Inductors help but then further interference shows up. If
                you want frequent spikes, they must be low power,and if you want
                low power,  this interference will silence out all the spikes in
                waves. One day to get around it would mean  1MB in 13m.  But for
                now, I simply increased the power and multiplied the spike hold.
                However, this means only twice the speed of regular  RICIN,  not
                many times more since it is possible as I tried, but the interf-
                erence. Summary: this provides robust transfer where  motion and
                extremely loud noises cammot disturb the data being induced.
